Most of the tools are available for use and training and in-house certification is provided, as the FabLab believes that you should be the one working on the practical side of the project to gain experience and know-how.  Of course, there will be staff-on-hand and trained personnel to help you along the way.

As a start, consider the following hand-phone holder/stand.

How would you construct the above project using

- only hand-tools (manual or powered)
- which tools would you consider essential to a maker?
- discuss within a group, a sample toolbox for makers.

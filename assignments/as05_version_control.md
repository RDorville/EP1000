### Assignment 5 Version Control

&nbsp;

###Content

In this assignment, you will install **git**.  If you are working on a Microsoft Windows 10 system, then I would strongly install **Github Desktop**, as we are more interested in the process of version control.  You will then put your blog into a "version control" system using git.

I would suggest working on a test site first before creating your blog sitefor this module.  You could name this site "testsite", create it on github and test it.  When you are confident, create your actual blogsite named "EP1000".


I have provided approximate timings for you so that you do **NOT** spend all your time (doing something you like and neglecting other modules!)

| Time   | Task |
|--------|:------------------------------------------------|
|10 min  | Install git/Github Desktop |
|20 min  | Watch *one* Youtube video on "git for beginners" |
|20 min  | Work through one online tutorial on git |
|40 min  | Convert your blog site to use git<br>Write-up the process of converting and implementing a version control<br>system on your blog |
|40 min  | Demonstrate how you would recover an error using git<br>Use your blog as the example, and show how you would recover a deleted paragraph.<br>**document it** in your blog.

Here is a quick guide on how to do the last part:

1. Familiarize yourself with git/Github Desktop (remember you can create new repositories on Github and remove them when you are finishted)
2. Write a paragraph of text, save your work on the remote repo (remember to put a meaningful comment)
3. Delete the paragraph and replace it with another paragraph, or make stupid changes to the paragraph.  Push the changes to the repository.
4. Examine the repository and extract/recover the lost data.
5. Remember to document as you go and clean up your documentation after you have done it.

This assignment is only due on Week 6 of this term.

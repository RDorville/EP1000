## Assignment 1 Safety (Graded)

&nbsp;

### Content

For this class, we will start by looking at the Safety issues concerning working in the FabLabs.  You will need to read through the material and perpare yourself for the class in which you will take the FabLab Safety Assessment.

You will need to score at least 90% before you are allowed to pass the assessment.

You will still need to take the assessment even though you may have covered (or taken) the/a Safety course and/or have take the FabLab Safety Assessment prior to joining this elective. It is always good to refresh ourselves to prevent accidents from happening.

I have provided approximate timings for you so that you do **NOT** spend all your time (doing something you like and neglecting other modules!)

**Software Installation**

During the course of this module, you will be required to use a number of software tools.  For a start, you will need this two:

1.  [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators)   
    This is a CADD (Computer Aided Design & Drafting) tool which allows you to digitally design, envision and simulate your project.  The link provided is to the Education version.  You should
    * Register as a student
    * Install and open up the software
    * Try one of the tutorials.

2.  A Text Editor   
    An important aspect of Project Management is documentation.  We need to keep a journal of our prototype project to show our journey, reflect on what we have done and provide a reference for future work.  An essential tool is the "pure" text editor.   
    Look at some of the *recommended* examples below and choose one that you feel suits your working environment the best, and install it on your computer.
    * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
    * [Atom](https://atom.io/)

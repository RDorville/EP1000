## Assignment 2 Prototyping

&nbsp;

### Content

For this assignment, we will try to develop a simple prototype by hand.  What is important is that you understand the concept and workflow that is used and try to implement the same workflow in your future prototypes.

In order to develop a prototype, we usually

1.  Have an idea of what we want to "make", do some research on it, find ideas.
2.  Sketch out the idea on a piece of paper, roughly at first, by pencil, and then highlighting the idea (in black ink, and colours)) of what it will look like.
3.  We add physical dimensions to the drawing to give some perspective of the size of the object
4.  Use corrugated cardboard and make a cardboard prototype.
5.  Test the prototype and make necessary changes to our original drawing, and refining our physical protoype as well.
6.  When satisfied, we can make a "hero shot" of our object.

We are now ready to "market" or "promote" our object to the world.

I have provided approximate timings for you so that you do **NOT** spend all your time (doing something you like and neglecting other modules!)

| Time   | Task |
|--------|:------------------------------------------------|
|15 min  | Research (Google) ideas for your object |
|30 min  | Sketch the object on paper, add dimensions |
|30 min  | Try making the object with corrugated cardboard |
|15 min  | Refine your object, make improvements |

### Todo

Some objects to make (choose any one)

- Portable handphone holder that you can put in your backpack
- Earbuds keeper to stop the wires from tangling
- Headphone keeper, to keep your headphones at the side of your table

1. Research your object on the internet.  Observe what has been done before, what hasn't been done, "borrow" ideas.  Take note of the location/URL where you took your idea from
2. Sketch your object on paper
    - it does not have to look neat (not everyone is an artist!)
    - ink out the defined shape when ready
    - put in physical dimensions to your sketch
    - colour the sketch to make it impressive
    - take a phone when done
3. Use corrugated cardboard to make a prototype
    - use the ideas given in the "Lab02" paper
    - use any corrugated cardboard you can find
        - recycle, reuse old boxes
        - try to keep the thickness to 3~4mm
        - make it to size, as close as possible
    - use hot melt glue, white paper glue or UHU to stick (Super Glue doesn't work!)
    - take a photo of your work
        + as you work
        + when you have finished
4. Test your "prototype" as an actual product
    - make necessary refinements on your sketch, changing dimensions or shape
    - correct them on your original prototype
    - take a "hero shot"
5. Write down you experiences in each of the sections as a "how-to" or blog (as a text file) to remind you of
    - how you made it step-by-step
    - what worked (so you can improve)
    - what didn't work (so that you will not repeat them)

> **Hero shot**
>
> A shot of a thing or person with framing, composition, lighting and setting intended to make it look as good as possible.
>
> In action-adventure movies, the hero shot is usually either the first appearance of the hero or early in the film, when, using dramatic cinematography, the hero is shown front and center in full costume.
>
> A candid picture of a person/object at their most typical. A shot of someone/object, often in the prime of their life, that sums up who that person/object was.

:blush: You will need this write-up in the next assignment.

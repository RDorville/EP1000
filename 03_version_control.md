##Version Control

Version control is the management of changes to documents, software, web sites and other collections of information.  In usual practise, the change of such documentation is done by labelling the filename or document with a number or letter code e.g. v1.01, v4a.

**[Reasons for version control](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408450/why-should-i-use-version-control)**

Assuming you are writing an essay/paper/code for an assignment that has to be submitted online, have you ever:

* Made a change to the work, realised it was a mistake and wanted to revert back?
* Lost work or had a backup that was too old?
* Had to maintain multiple versions of the assignment ?
* Wanted to see the difference between two (or more) versions of your work?
* Wanted to prove that a particular change broke or fixed a section of your work?
* Wanted to review the history of some work, to see what you deleted?
* Wanted to submit a change to someone else's work, in collaboration with yours?
* Wanted to share your work, or let other people help work on your assignment?
* Wanted to see how much work is being done, and where, when and by whom?
* Wanted to experiment with a new feature without interfering with the current working assignment?

If you answered **YES** to any of the above questions, then you need a version control system.

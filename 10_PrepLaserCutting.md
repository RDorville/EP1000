## Preparing for laser cutting

In this session, we will look at how to prepare our designs for laser cutting.  CAD helps use visualise our work in a 3D model, however, in order to laser cut our design, we need to lay out the design in a 2D form.  We also have to make certain considerations to our design before we laser cut.

### Laser cutting

*  Laser cutting is a process where material is placed in the X-Y plane and a [LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser) is moved across the profile to be cut out.  
*  A laser can be focused to a tight spot, which allows the beam to "cut" at the position.
*  The high intensity of the beam causes the material to be vaporised (cut away).  
*  Since the light can be focused, a very thin cut is made.  Electronics and machine control make the cut precise and repeatable.
*  The laser can be programmed to have a continous wave or pulsed repeatedly to produce the cut.
*  The process of laser cutting is controlled by
    *  The speed of the movement of the laser 
        * Slow speeds allow the laser more time over the material and cuts deeper and more intensely.
        * Slow speeds also cause charring of the material.
    *  The intensity of the laser
        *  Higher intensities of the laser can cut deeper
        *  Higher intensities are sometimes required as the material is more dense than others
    *  The number of pulses per second.
        *  Most lasers are pulsed.  The higher the number of pulses per second give higher intensities and prolonged exposure to the laser.
        *  Higher pulsing reates are required for dense material
    *  Most lasers settings come with recommendations from the manufacturer or the Technicians and are dependent upon
        -  The material (e.g. wood, acrylic, paper)
        -  The thickness of the material
        -  The color/coloration of the material.
    *  Please consult the Technician-in-charge before you cut your objects.  They have valuable advice and experience to share with you.

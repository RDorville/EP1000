## FAQ

<a name="faq001"></a>**FAQ 001** Site does not display when URL is clicked

* The default page which the website displays is **index.html** or **index.md** or **readme.md**.
* You need to name your "root" page one of the above

<a name="faq002"></a>**FAQ 002** Please don't use [click here](http://google.com) or [press here](http://google.com) to indicate a link.

* Most users know what is a link and where to click it.
* It would be better to use [Google Search](http://google.com)

<a name="faq003"></a>**FAQ 003** Why can't I have a single webpage as my website?

* A website is broken to sections/pages making reading easier.  Topics are convered in a single page which is linked within the site.
* Readers don't like to have to scroll forever looking for the section.

<a name="faq004"></a>**FAQ 004** My images do not show.

* Image was not included in the site (need to upload the image)
* (windows users) Watch out for upper/lower case in the filename. E.g. MyPicture.jpg vs mypicture.jpg.   
    - Most servers are Linux-based and observe upper/lowercase differentiation.
* Image is in a different folder, you need to navigate to the location.

<a name="faq005"></a>**FAQ 005** when do I use tables (HTML)?

* You use tables when you need to represent data in an organised form.
* A table has to load completely before the data is presented, so tables should be smaller than a page.
* Use \<div\> if you want to do layout.

<a name="faq006"></a>**FAQ 006** Why do I need to use CSS with HTML, my site already looks great!

* HTML should be used to layout the page. There should not be any formatting instructions (e.g. color, font, size)
* CSS does not interfere with the information on the page.  It is used to change the "look" and "feel" by adding color, fonts, sizing
* A HTML page can be used with different CSS files for different user experiences.

<a name="faq007"></a>**FAQ 007** My website is professionally done - so what's wrong with it?

* As long as you can update your website easily, no problems, even if you use an external web generator or Adobe Illustrator or MS Word.
* Can you explain to your reader how to "make" such a page?  You have to do it in the 2nd topic - Website development.
* if You pass this to your group, can they update the work?
* This module is directed toward "sharing" information, as long as you and your group can do it, why not!

<a name="faq008"></a>**FAQ 008** Sir, I see a lot of **&amp;nbsp;** in your Markdown. What is this special "term"?

* &amp;nbsp; is HTML for non-breaking space.  That is, don't split the line here if you have to.  Two words that have a &nbsp; between them will not split across two lines.
* I use it to generate blank lines for spacing.


<a name="faq009"></a>**FAQ 009** How to embed a Fusion 360 file in your web page?

*  Please follow this how-to: Fusion 360 [How to embed a viewer of a Fusion 360 design into a website](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-embed-a-viewer-of-a-Fusion-360-design-into-a-website.html)

**Example**

The code from the Autodesk site is placed directly in the Markdown file.  The code sample is reproduced below.  You may need to wait a bit before the image shows.

```html
<iframe src="https://myhub.autodesk360.com/ue2dff438/shares/public/SH56a43QTfd62c1cd968a8254af243cf0912?mode=embed" width="800" height="600" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

<a name="faq010"></a>**FAQ 010**  How-to display a 3D Model (.STL) in a HTML file

* Use Javascript plugins: [JSC3D](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jsc3d/)
    1.  Read the reference documents and examples from the Site above.
    2.  Download the repository, extract the following `.jsc3d` files and place in a location with your HTML files (e.g. folder `jsc3d`)
        - jsc3d.js
        - jsc3d.webgl.js
        - jsc3d.touch.js    
        You need to load these files in with your HTML.
    3.  Load the JavaScript plugin code in the header area

        ```html
        <head>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="jsc3d/jsc3d.js"></script>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="jsc3d/jsc3d.webgl.js"></script>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="jsc3d/jsc3d.touch.js"></script>
        </head>
        ```

    4.  Use the following code to load the STL file and display it:

        ```html
        <canvas id="cv" width=640 height=480>
            It seems you are using an outdated browser that does not support canvas :-(
        </canvas>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            var canvas = document.getElementById('cv');
            var viewer = new JSC3D.Viewer(canvas);
            viewer.setParameter('SceneUrl','knight.stl');
            viewer.setParameter('ModelColor','#CAA618');
            viewer.setParameter('BackgroundColor1','#E5D7BA');
            viewer.setParameter('BackgroundColor2','#383840');
            viewer.setParameter('RenderMode','flat');
            viewer.setParameter('MipMapping','on');
            viewer.setParameter('Definition','high');
            viewer.setParameter('Renderer','webgl');
            viewer.init();
            viewer.update();
        </script>
        ```

    5.  Change this line to point to your .STL file

        ```html

         viewer.setParameter('SceneUrl','knight.stl');

        ```

**Example:** [3D model of a Knight Chess Piece](06_STLmodel.html)

You can also embed it into the HTML or Markdown file using the following code:

```html
<iframe src="06_STLmodel.html"
    width="800" height="600"
    allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"
>
</iframe>
```

<iframe src="06_STLmodel.html"
    width="800" height="1024"
    allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"
>
</iframe>

## FAQ

<a name="faq001"></a>**FAQ 001** Site does not display when URL is clicked

* The default page which the website displays is **index.html** or **index.md** or **readme.md**.
* You need to name your "root" page one of the above

<a name="faq002"></a>**FAQ 002** Please don't use [click here](http://google.com) or [press here](http://google.com) to indicate a link.

* Most users know what is a link and where to click it.
* It would be better to use [Google Search](http://google.com)

<a name="faq003"></a>**FAQ 003** Why can't I have a single webpage as my website?

* A website is broken to sections/pages making reading easier.  Topics are convered in a single page which is linked within the site.
* Readers don't like to have to scroll forever looking for the section.

<a name="faq004"></a>**FAQ 004** My images do not show.

* Image was not included in the site (need to upload the image)
* (windows users) Watch out for upper/lower case in the filename. E.g. MyPicture.jpg vs mypicture.jpg.   
    - Most servers are Linux-based and observe upper/lowercase differentiation.
* Image is in a different folder, you need to navigate to the location.

<a name="faq005"></a>**FAQ 005** when do I use tables (HTML)?

* You use tables when you need to represent data in an organised form.
* A table has to load completely before the data is presented, so tables should be smaller than a page.
* Use \<div\> if you want to do layout.

<a name="faq006"></a>**FAQ 006** Why do I need to use CSS with HTML, my site already looks great!

* HTML should be used to layout the page. There should not be any formatting instructions (e.g. color, font, size)
* CSS does not interfere with the information on the page.  It is used to change the "look" and "feel" by adding color, fonts, sizing
* A HTML page can be used with different CSS files for different user experiences.

<a name="faq007"></a>**FAQ 007** My website is professionally done - so what's wrong with it?

* As long as you can update your website easily, no problems, even if you use an external web generator or Adobe Illustrator or MS Word.
* Can you explain to your reader how to "make" such a page?  You have to do it in the 2nd topic - Website development.
* if You pass this to your group, can they update the work?
* This module is directed toward "sharing" information, as long as you and your group can do it, why not!

<a name="faq008"></a>**FAQ 008** Sir, I see a lot of **&amp;nbsp;** in your Markdown. What is this special "term"?

* &amp;nbsp; is HTML for non-breaking space.  That is, don't split the line here if you have to.  Two words that have a &nbsp; between them will not split across two lines.
* I use it to generate blank lines for spacing.

## EP1000 Digital Fabrication Prototyping Fundamentals

In this module you will learn how to use Digital Fabrication techniques in designing and creating prototypes.  In the process you will learn how to
document and publish your work.  You will use Computer Aided Design techniques, 3D printing and laser cutting methods to develop your prototype.  In addition, you will be use a microcontroller to add intelligence to your project.

This module is offered as an elective to students of Singapore Polytechnic as part of their Diploma course.

## Module Aims

In this elective, students are introduced to design thinking concepts, which they will use to design some functional prototypes to meet certain user requirements. Fundamental digital fabrication skills and technologies such as computer-aided design, 2D and 3D modelling, mechanical & electronic design and programming skills are developed through a range of hands-on real world activities. Project management, web and version control techniques, which are important for project development, will also be imparted to students.

&nbsp;

## Teaching Methods

The module incorporates active and experiential learning (CDIO Standard 8) through a combination of tutorials, e-learning and practical workshop sessions. To help the students better understand the basic essential concepts, demonstrations will also be conducted in the lab/workshop (CDIO Standard 6). Audio visual media, hardware and various teaching aids will be used in the course delivery for effective learning.

Students have to demonstrate their ability to work individually and in groups to encourage teamwork, personal and interpersonal communication skills.

&nbsp;

## Method of Assessment

Assessment will be based on exercises and projects through three in-course assessments (ICA) as follows:

| S/No   | Code   | Description                    | Weightage  |
|:------:|:------:|--------------------------------|:----------:|
| 1      |CA1     | Safety, Documentation, Website | 20%        |
| 2      |CA2     | Digital Fabrication Skills     | 40%        |
| 3      |CA3     | Summative Project              | 40%        |

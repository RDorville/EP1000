## EP1000 Digital Fabrication Prototyping Fundamentals

In this module you will learn how to use Digital Fabrication techniques in designing and creating prototypes.  In the process you will learn how to
document and publish your work.  You will use Computer Aided Design techniques, 3D printing and laser cutting methods to develop your prototype.  In addition,
you will be use a microcontroller to add intelligence to your project.

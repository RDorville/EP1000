### Assignment: Lasercutting

In this assignment, you will lasercut the box you created in a previous assignment.

I have provided approximate timings for you so that you do **NOT** spend all your time (doing something you like and neglecting other modules!)

| Time   | Task |
|--------|:------------------------------------------------|
|30 min  | Watch a tutorial on LaserCutting & Kerf |
|30 min  | Export and layout your 3D model for laser cutting  |
|60 min  | Submit your work for lasercutting |

This is a short assignment, since you have Mid-semester tests & assignments, but should keep you occupied during the holidays.  Try to complete all layouts in DXF so that you can provide them to the TSO when required..

Here is a quick guide:

1.  Watch both of the videos above to get an idea of how laser cutting works and the definition of kerf.
2.  Return to your parametric box and add a lid/cover to the box
3.  Export the parts to DXF and prepare a layout for lasercutting.  Use the following parameters:
    * thickness of wood 3.4mm
    * size of entire layout, no larger than A3 (optimal A4) size
    * minimize the wastage of material
    * save as a single DXF file ready for lasercutting.
4.  Present your work at FabLab Central for laser cutting
5.  Assemble your box and document your experience for grading:
    - you documentation should resemble a how-to for preparation of lasercutting
    - include the preparation work in CorelDraw
    - include working and final "hero" shots
    - include the following files:
        - Fusion 260 design file in .f3d format
        - the CorelDraw layout file (.CDR format)
    - include the lasercutter settings used to cut the material

### Additional Work


1.  Examine the following references:
    * Instructables: [Press-fit Construction Kit](https://www.instructables.com/id/Press-fit-Construction-Kit/) Spheres
    * Instructables: [Press-fit Construction Fit Wooden Cat](https://www.instructables.com/id/PRESS-FIT-CONSTRUCTION-FIT-WOODEN-CAT/)
    * Google Search: [Press fit construction kit laser cutting](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Press-fit+construction+kit+laser+cutting&t=canonical&ia=web)
2.  Design a simple press-fit kit for yourself, taking into considerstion:
    * the wood thickness
    * the kerf (to be calculated from lab experiments)
    * about 2~5 pieces which can be reused.
    * FabWiki: [Inkscape how to make a pressfit design](http://wiki.fablab.is/wiki/Inkscape_how_to_make_a_pressfit_design)
3.  Layout your pieces (can be multiple) ready for laser cutting.

Remember to document your work and include 
*  screen-shots and how-tos, appropriately written
*  original Fusion 360 and DXF files
*  a **hero-shot** of your work (which can be added later) after lasercutting

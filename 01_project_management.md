# Project Management

The objective of this module is to help you create a prototype of an object.  However, before we can start any fabrication it is good to have a plan or series of tasks which we need to follow to reach our objective.  This is project management.

## Safety Issues

Fablab @ Singapore Polytechnic has a large number of tools, equipment and machinery which you can use to fabricate your project.  In the course of the module, you will be taught the operation of some of these tools and equipment, however before that, we need to ensure your safety in the lab.

The **Safety Assessment** is mandatory for all users of Fablab@SP.  The documentation and notes for the couse is common throughout all couses and is available on the [E-learning Site at SP](https://esp.sp.edu.sg).  You are encouraged to go through the material before taking the Safety Assessment.

Unfortunately, we require that the Safety Assessment be done physically at the lab, and as such will be postponed until the laboratories are open for use.  This will be the first task you undertake upon entering the lab.

## Project Management

[Project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management) helps you plan and execute your tasks that lead to the sucess of your project.  In short, it is the management of

* Scope   
  This determines how much you can do in your project and is usually a function of time.  Given time, anything is achieveable.
* Time   
  How much time do you have to complete your project. This is the main factor in most projects.  The management of time is perhaps, the most important aspects of project management.
* Resources   
  This is the material, personnel, situations that you have to work with.  Think about a project to build a wall, before you can even start, you need to assess what materials are required, order and have it delivered, well before you can even start to build.
* Results   
  Everyone looks for a successful project. What happens if you do not have enough time or resources, what can you show to qualify what you have done.

Project management tools

* [GanttProject](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openproj/)   
  A traditional-style Gantt project management system, open-source, good for managing large projects.
  
* [Trello](https://trello.com/stevenchew17/boards)   
  A new style, with a snappy interface for quick viewing of tasks and issues for a project group.  This is ideal for your project in the module.


Ideas/References that may help you plan your project

* [Spiral development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model)   
  This project management style looks at how much you can achieve given a set amount of time to each task.  Once the time is up, you should move on towards the next step, regardless of whether the previous step was entirely successful.  In this manner, the project gets completed, but may have certain areas that are not wholly completed.

* [Protoypting: iterative vs parallel](https://medium.com/ucsddesignco/iterative-vs-parallel-prototyping-575d455da5b5)   
  Good article on how prototypes are completed. At times you need to use a trial-and-error-repeat style, while at times your team can work at different aspects of the project at the same time.

* [Mythical man-month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)   
  Essays on project management by Fred Brooks.  Basicly, the central theme is adding more personell to a later project does not finish the project faster. Analogiously speaking: It takes 9 months to concieve a baby, adding more people does not make it any faster.


###Assignment 1

For this week, we will start by looking at some Safety issues, identify common tools that you will work with in the Fablab and prepare software on your laptop for the tasks ahead.

I have provided approximate timings for you so that you do **NOT** spend all your time (doing something you like and neglecting other modules!)

| Time   | Task |
|--------|:------------------------------------------------|
|45 min  | Go through the Safety slides on the eSP site, prepare yourself for the Safety Assessment |
|15 min  | Read the online article on [Protoypting: iterative vs parallel](https://medium.com/ucsddesignco/iterative-vs-parallel-prototyping-575d455da5b5) |
|15 min  | What tools do I need in my tool-kit? |
|30 min  | Software installation - Fusion 360, Text Editor |

**Safety Assessment**

1.  Login to [E-learning@SP](https://esp.sp.edu.sg) and go to the module page EP1000
2.  Under Learning Resources, select **Fablab Safety**
3.  Read the documents provided under this section.  It is important that you are familiar with its contents.

**Tools**

What are the common tools that I should have in a tool-kit for my home? Prepare a list of tools that you may need based on the following:

1. How often it is used and its purpose
2. Safety aspects in using that tool

What are the common powered tools that I would like to have in my tool-kit as well?

**Software Installation**

During the course of this module, you will be required to use a number of software tools.  For a start, you will need this two:

1.  [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators)   
    This is a CADD (Computer Aided Design & Drafting) tool which allows you to digitally design, envision and simulate your project.  The link provided is to the Education version.  You should
    * Register as a student
    * Install and open up the software
    * Try one of the tutorials.

2.  A Text Editor   
    An important aspect of Project Management is documentation.  We need to keep a journal of our prototype project to show our journey, reflect on what we have done and provide a reference for future work.  An essential tool is the "pure" text editor.   
    Look at some of the *recommended* examples below and choose one that you feel suits your working environment the best, and install it on your computer.
    * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
    * [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    * [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
    * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**Questions**

You must be able to answer the following questions:

1. Why is Safety important in the Fablab?
2. What is Personal Protective Equipment, and what can I use in the lab?

You will be required to present your work to the class as the next session.

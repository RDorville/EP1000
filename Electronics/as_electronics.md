## Assignment: [Electronics](as_electronics.md)

In this assignment, you will attempt to learn some basic electronics.  You have a fantastic online tool to help you with your work and you should learn how to be familiar with it.

The practical session of this assignment is to 
-  read an article on how to create a LED flasher with a 555 integrated circuit
-  test your circuit using a breadboard
-  solder your circuit onto a veroboard/stripboard

The skills you will learn are:
-  understanding an electronic circuit
-  how to test your circuit using a breadboard
-  soldering skills

I have provided approximate timings for you so that you do **NOT** spend all your time (doing something you like and neglecting other modules!)

| Time   | Task |
|--------|:------------------------------------------------|
|30 min  | Watch the Youtube tutorials on TinkerCAD circuits |
|60 min  | Participate and learn basic electronics with OpenLearn |
|15 min  | Read an article on how to create a LED flasher |
|60 min  | Wire up your circuit on a breadboard, and test it|
|60 min  | Solder your circuit on a veroboard/stripboard |

This is a rather longer assignment, however, you have the term break holidays to work though this assignment.  Come to the Fablab for advice and help.

Here is a quick guide:

**On the laptop:**

1.  Watch the YouTube videos above to get an idea of how TinkerCAD Circuit works and how to use it.
2.  Familiarize yourself with the common electrical components and try out designing some circuits.
3.  Go through the OpenLearn course on Basic Electronics.

**Practical Session:**

1.  Read the article [**How to use veroboard**](http://www.bestsoldering.com/how-to-use-veroboard/)
    - understand what is required
    - list out which components are required
2.  Test your circuit using a breadboard, the following articles will help
    - Youtube [How to use a breadboard](https://youtu.be/6WReFkfrUIk)
    - Collect the components from T1442 EA Fablab
    - Wire up and test your circuit in the lab (ask for help if needed!)
3.  Re-read the article, then solder up the circuit on a breadboard.  The following videos will help:
    - Youtube [How to Solder](https://www.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEB&search_query=how+to+solder+stripboard+)
    - Follow the instructions and create your veroboard/stripboard circuit

### Graded

This assignment is graded.

For the grade, you have to 

- Document your work, showing how to have mastered the breadboard circuit and the stripboard for simple circuit construction
- Write a how-to on creating the stripboard circuit
- Document your errors and success stories
- Have proper photos and "hero-shots"

## Creating Models using Fusion 360

Fusion 360 is AutoDesk's latest product into CAD.  It takes the best features from AutoCAD and Inventor, adds CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing), Sculpting and Electronics Design to the system.  Best of all, the software is available to Students for a 3 year-lease period.

Here are some main topics that you need to master in Fusion 360:

*  The user interface
*  Saving and exporting designs
*  2D sketching
*  Drawing constraints and how to apply them
*  Extrusion

### 3D Models

We will cover 3D models in detail in the following lesson, however as a preview, there are only 3 methods in which we can use to create a digitized 3D model of an object using CAD.  They are

1. by Extrusion<br>
    creating a 2D outline in one plane and then extruding or extending the outline of the object in the axis perpendicular to that plane.
2. by Revolution<br>
    creating a 2D outline in one plane/shape and then revolving the outline/shape a number of degrees in the perpendicular plane.  This method is ideal for creating cylindrical objects.
3. by Sculpting<br>
    this method is akin to playing with plasticine.  We start with a defined object e.g. block, cylinder, sphere and then by pushing and pulling surfaces we are able to create a 3D model of the object.

### Assignment: Creating Models

In this assignment, you will use the skills learnt in Fusion360 to create 2 objects - a nametag and a fidget spinner.  For this assignment, we will only create the 3D model of both objects, and learn how to display them in our blogs.  You will have the opportunity to create them using a 3D printer at a later date.

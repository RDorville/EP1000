&nbsp;

### Content

In this assignment, you will complete at least 2 major designs using Fusion 360 to ensure that you have a working knowledge of the commands and how to use the software.

I have provided approximate timings for you so that you do **NOT** spend all your time (doing something you like and neglecting other modules!)

| Time   | Task |
|--------|:------------------------------------------------|
|45 min  | Go through the video Tutorials listed above |
|30 min  | Design a name tag for your keyring |
|60 min  | Design a fidget spinner |

Here is a quick guide:

1.  Design a name tag for your key chain.  Follow the specifications and guidelines in the instruction sheet.
2.  Design a fidget spinner using a roller-skate bearing and M8 nuts.  Use the following as a guide, you may change the design if you so wish.

2. [Fidget Spinner](worksheets/f360_fidgetspinner.md)

**Specifications**

    * short notes on how you created the design (there should be at least 3-4 paragraphs with appropriate screen captures/photographs)
    * screen shots of your finished product.
    * highlight any tips that you would want your classmates to know if they were to complete the same projects.

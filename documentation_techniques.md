## Documentation Techniques

The important function of documentation is to provide a "timely" source of
information, so that

* You group members are kept up to date with the progress
* It is a log of the progress (success/failures) that you can refer to
* Provide a reference to future projects.

Hence a documentation tool should:

* Be easy to learn and use.
* Available
* Easily accessible

Good and popular solutions to this problem is to use a **text editor** and create Internet website that can be hosted on the **World-wide-web**.

### Text Editors

A good text editor should be simple to use and available on a variety of platforms.  The choice is arbitary, however, the following criterion are often used to make a choice:

* Produces pure text files
* WSIWYG - What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get
* Simple to use, yet powerful editing features
* Syntax highlighting to show tags/keywords
* Recommendations:
    - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) a popular choice among programmers, not free but has unlimited use time.

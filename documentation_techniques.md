### Documentation Techniques

The important function of documentation is to provide a "timely" source of
information, so that

* You group members are kept up to date with the progress
* It is a log of the progress (success/failures) that you can refer to
* Provide a reference to future projects.

Hence a documentation tool should:

* Be easy to learn and use.
* Available
* Easily accessible

> - in the marking (to be released soon)

#### Can I use already projects/codes from projects found on the Internet?
> Yes, provided you

> - produce all the CAD files
> - make changes to adapt the original code/ideas
> - must not be a 100% copy/clone

#### Are we allowed to work in Groups?
> For this period (Sem 1 Session 2020) - **No**

#### If the lab doesn't quite have the module that we want. Can we find and use our own components on our project?

> Yes, provided you have
> 
>  1. Documented all your work

>  3. Created the case/fittings using Laser cutting and 3D printing
>  4. Used 
>      - an Arduino Uno or micro controller
>      - Interfaced an output device
>      - Interfaced an input device
>      - made changes to your code to reflect your own design parameters

#### You've asked us to produce initial sketches of our ideas.  Where do we submit these ideas?<br>
>  You should scan/take photos of your sketches and place them into your project folder.  This provides useful information towards your thought process and design.
>  You could create the following structure on you website
>  root
>  -  HTML files on each week's work and assignments
>  -  images folder
>  -  project folder
>     -  sketches, photos, video

## Learning Fusion 360

Fusion 360 is AutoDesk's latest product into CAD.  It takes the best features from AutoCAD and Inventor, adds CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing), Sculpting and Electronics Design to the system.  Best of all, the software is available to Students for a 3 year-lease period.

Here are some main topics that you need to master in Fusion 360:

*  The user interface
*  Saving and exporting designs
*  2D sketching
*  Drawing contraints and how to apply them
*  Extrusion

### Assignment 5

In this assignment, you will complete at least 2 major designs using Fusion 360 to ensur that you have a working knowledge of the commands and how to use the software.

I have provided approximate timings for you so that you do **NOT** spend all your time (doing something you like and neglecting other modules!)

| Time   | Task |
|--------|:------------------------------------------------|
|45 min  | Go through the video Tutorials listed aboveL |
|30 min  | Design a nametag for your keyring |
|60 min  | Design a fidget spinner |

Here is a quick guide:

1.  Design a nametag for your keychain.  Follow the specifications and guidelines in the instruction sheet.
2.  Design a fidget spinner using a roller-skate bearing and M8 nuts.  Use the following as a guide, you may change the design if you so wish.

**Specifications**

* Document your work as you go, remember to attach
    * short notes on how you created the design
    * the exported Fusion 360 design file (.f3d)
    * screen shots of your finished product. 
    * highlight any tips that you would want your classmates to know if they were to complete the same projects.
+ Update your blog with the work done.
